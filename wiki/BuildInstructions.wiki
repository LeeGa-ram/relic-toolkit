==Introduction==

The build process requires the [http://www.cmake.org/ CMake] cross-platform build system. This should make RELIC available in all platforms supported by CMake.

==Steps==

In the steps below, replace _version_ by the release version.

First of all, extract the RELIC release archive:

{{{
tar xzvf relic-version.tar.gz
}}}

This should create a directory named `relic-version`. Create a target directory:

{{{
mkdir -p relic-target
}}}

Run cmake inside the target directory:

{{{
cd relic-target
cmake ../relic-version
}}}

CMake will detect a suitable C compiler and show all the customization options. For now, just compile the library:

{{{
make
cd ..
}}}

By default, static and shared libraries will be built in the `relic-target/lib` directory. Tests and benchmarks should be built in `relic-target/bin`. You can run the automated testes by running each binary independently or by using CTest:

{{{
ctest relic_target/test
}}}

The customization options are described in BuildOptions. You can change these by running:

{{{
ccmake relic_target
}}}

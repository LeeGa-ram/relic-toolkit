==Introduction==

RELIC is a meta-toolkit with strong emphasis in customization. This document details all the build options available in the 0.2.1 release.

==Customization==

Build options can be changed by using the CMake building system. CMake provides two ways of customizing options: using the `ccmake` interactive utility or by calling the `cmake` command with `-D` directives. For example, to assign a fictional switch `SWITCH` using the command-line tool, run:

{{{
cmake -DSWITCH=on path_to_target
}}}

==Available build options==

In this section, we present all the build options grouped by purpose. For each build option, we specify its type and the possible values it may assume.

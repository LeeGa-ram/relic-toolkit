==Release 0.2.3==

 * Fixed a TinyPBC integration bug.

==Release 0.2.2==

 * Updated the TinyPBC AVR profile and released the arithmetic backend for fast binary field arithmetic and fast pairing computing on AVR devices.

==Release 0.2.1==

 * Added a new faster memory allocator called AUTO. It is now the default and will replace the STACK allocator in the next releases.
 * Several bugs fixed.

==Release 0.2.0==

 * Added support for prime fields and standard NIST curves over prime fields.
 * Added support for Barreto-Naehrig pairing-friendly curves and the R-ate pairing.
 * Added an abstraction layer so that protocols can be implemented over a generic pairing e : G_1 x G_2 -> G_T.

==Release 0.1.2==

 * Fixed several OSX-only bugs.

==Release 0.1.1==

 * Included support for TinyPBC targets.

==Release 0.1.0==

 * Initial release supporting multi-precision arithmetic, binary fields, NIST binary curves and the nT pairing over supersingular curves.
